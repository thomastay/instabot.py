> Toolkit for building automated Instagram bots without direct access to the Instagram API or passsing through the review process.

This is a fork of instabot.py by Lev Pasha, which I use for my own instagram bots (for research purposes ONLY). The master branch is a stable branch which is kept up-to-date with the original master branch and updated with my updates. The dev branch is where I develop.
